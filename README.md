# Example Project: Collections Implementation in CPP

Example Project for implementing a package with several collections/lists in
C++.

Collections implemented are:

- Queue
- ArrayList
- LinkedList
- Stack

Currently, the project is just the idea of what a collections library looks
like.

The header files contain the corresponding implementation in the same .h file
because I had a trouble with templates the last time I wrote this code and
wasn't able to use .cpp files.
