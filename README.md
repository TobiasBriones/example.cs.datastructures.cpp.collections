Example Project for for implementing a package with several collections/lists in C++.

Collections implemented are:
- Queue
- ArrayList
- LinkedList
- Stack

Currently, the project is just the idea of what a collections library looks like. 

The header files contain the corresponding implementation in the same .h file because I had a trouble with templates the last time I wrote this code and wasn't able to use .cpp files.
